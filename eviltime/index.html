        <h1>Welcome to <em>EVILTime.TF</em></h1>
        <p><em>EVIL Time</em> is just <em>PASS TIme 4v4</em> with an inverted item whitelist.</p>
        <p>Normally, <em>PASS Time 4v4</em>'s item whitelist consists of movement based weapons, such as the <em>Gunboats</em> and <em>Market Gardener</em> for <em>Soldier</em>, the <em>Ali Baba's Wee Booties</em> and <em>Splendid Screen</em>for <em>Demoman</em>,</p>
        <p>PASS Time 4v4 also has 4 players on each team, but EVIL Time has 3 players on each team, due to the way the match can get insanely chaotic with 4 players.</p>
        <p><em>EVIL Time</em>'s whitelist consists of items such as the <em>Stickybomb Launcher</em>, <em>Quickiebomb launcher</em>, and <em>Tide Turner</em> for <em>Demoman</em>, and items like the <em>Buff Banner</em> and many more for <em>Soldier</em>.</p>
        <p>Some parts of the whitelist remain unchanged though, as they are fundemental parts of the gameplay, such as the <em>Market Gardener</em> for <em>Soldier</em>.</p>
